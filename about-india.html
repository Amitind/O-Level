					<h1>History of India</h1>
					<p class="lead uppercase">The Indian Peninsula stands apart from the rest of Asia, bordered as it is by mountains
						and the sea, which gives the country a distinct geographical entity. Based on the phases of evolution of the
						country and its people the history of India can be categorised in three major categories.</p>

					<dt class="col-sm-3">Ancient History</dt>
					<dd class="col-sm-9">India's history and culture is dynamic, spanning back to the beginning of human civilization.
						It begins with a mysterious culture along the Indus River and in farming communities in the southern lands of
						India. The history of India is punctuated by constant integration of migrating people with the diverse cultures
						that surround India. Available evidence suggests that the use of iron, copper and other metals was widely
						prevalent in the Indian sub-continent at a fairly early period, which is indicative of the progress that this
						part of the world had made. By the end of the fourth millennium BC, India had emerged as a region of highly
						developed civilization.</dd>
					<dt class="col-sm-3">Medieval History</dt>
					<dd class="col-sm-9">
						<p>For a period that has come to be so strongly associated with the Islamic influence and rule in India, Medieval
							Indian history went for almost three whole centuries under the so-called indigenous rulers, that included the
							Chalukyas, the Pallavas, the Pandyas, the Rashtrakutas, the Muslims rulers and finally the Mughal Empire. The
							most important dynasty to emerge in the middle of the 9th century was that of the Cholas.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt class="col-sm-3">Freedom Struggle</dt>
					<dd class="col-sm-9">
						<p>In ancient times, people from all over the world were keen to come to India. ThePersians followed by the
							Iranians and Parsis immigrated to India. Then came theMoghuls and they too settled down permanently in India.
							Chengis Khan, the Mongolian, invaded and looted India many times. Alexander the Great too, came to conquer India
							but went back after a battle with Porus. He-en Tsang from China came in pursuit of knowledge and to visit the
							ancient Indian universities of Nalanda and Takshila. Columbus wanted to come to India, but instead landed on the
							shores of America. Vasco da Gama from Portugal came to trade his country's goods in return for Indian spices.
							The French came and established their colonies in India.</p>
						<p>Lastly, the Britishers came and ruled over India for nearly 200 years. After the battle of Plassey in 1757,
							the British achieved political power in India. And their paramountcy was established during the tenure of Lord
							Dalhousie, who became the Governor- General in 1848. He annexed Punjab, Peshawar and the Pathan tribes inthe
							north-west of India. And by 1856, the British conquest and its authority were firmly established. And while the
							British power gained its heights during the middle of the 19th century, the discontent of the local rulers, the
							peasantry, the intellectuals, common masses as also of the soldiers who became unemployed due to the disbanding
							of the armies of various states that were annexed by the British, became widespread. This soon broke out into a
							revolt which assumed the dimensions of the 1857 Mutiny.</p>

						<p class="lead pt-2"> India map of climate classification. A semi-arid area in the rain shadow region near
							Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu. Monsoon clouds dump torrents of rain on lush forests that are only some kilometres away
							in windward-facing Kerala, but are prevented from reaching Tirunelveli by the Agasthyamalai Range of the Western
							Ghats (background). </p>
						<p class="lead pt-2">A scene in Uttarakhand's Valley of Flowers National Park. In contrast to the rain shadow
							region of Tirunelveli, the park receives ample orographic precipitation due to its location in a mountainous
							windward-facing region wedged between the Zanskars and the Greater Himalayas. The formation of the Himalayas
							(pictured) during the Early Eocene some 52 mya was a key factor in determining India's modern-day climate;
							global climate and ocean chemistry may have been impacted.</p>
						<p class="lead pt-2">The Climate of India comprises a wide range of weather conditions across a vast geographic
							scale and varied topography, making generalisations difficult. Based on the Köppen system, India hosts six major
							climatic subtypes, ranging from arid desert in the west, alpine tundra and glaciers in the north, and humid
							tropical regions supporting rainforests in the southwest and the island territories.</p>
